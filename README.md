# Digit-Recognizer-CNN

This is an implementation for the problem of digit recognition competition from kaggle. I have used a Convolutional neural network to classify the digits

# Dataset
The dataset can be obtained from the kaggle competition page.

# Libraries used
1) numpy
2) scikit-learn
3) matplotlib
4) Seaborn
5) Pandas
6) keras using tensorflow backend

# To run
python digit_recognizer.py

However the complete code was created on google colab. So you will need to remove the part which was used to upload the dataset to colab
